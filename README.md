This Minecraft datapack aims to recreate the world of "Wings of Fire" by author Tui T. Sutherland in-game!

How to Install:
1. Download the datapack (Clone or download -> Download ZIP)
2. Open your 1.16.X Minecraft world folder, then the "datapacks" folder (Main menu -> Singleplayer -> Select a world, then edit -> Open World Folder -> datapacks).
3. In the folder you just downloaded is another folder called "elytras-of-fire-master," and inside that is "ids-wings-of-fire." Drag that folder into the "datapacks" folder in your world folder.
4. If you are already logged into your world, type /reload. If this does not show a welcome message, type /datapack enable "file/ids-wings-of-fire" first, then do /reload.
5. Done!
