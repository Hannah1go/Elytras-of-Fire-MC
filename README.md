This Minecraft datapack aims to recreate the world of "Wings of Fire" by author Tui T. Sutherland in-game!

How to Use:
1. Open the Minecraft world folder (Main menu -> Singleplayer -> Select a world, then edit -> Open World Folder).
2. Open the "datapacks" folder, and place the first folder called "ids-wings-of-fire" in the "datapacks" folder.
3. Go into your world, and type /reload. If this does not show a welcome message, type /datapack enable "file/ids-wings-of-fire" first, then do /reload.
4. Done!
