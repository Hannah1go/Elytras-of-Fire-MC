Heya! Dino here â€” you know, the creator of the datapack.

On that note, if you are using the datapack for private use (singleplayer world,
LAN world, etc.) it's all good! Just remember to let people know that I'm the
creator... seeing as, well, I am!

If you're gonna use it publicly, run it by me first, let me know what you're going
to be doing, and I'll most likely say yes. However, you gotta remember to get my
permission first, or else it is an automatic NO (capitals included!).

Also, please don't tamper with any links in the files. Believe me: none of your
friends are doing it, so it must not be cool, right? I don't want monetary profit
from this project, so my links are how I benefit.

Finally, if you are going to distribute my datapack, I can't stop you. Though, I
would prefer you link people to the official download on Github, just so others
can verify the download is safe to use. (If you didn't get this datapack directly
from Github, don't unzip it! It might have scary stuff in it, and is likely NOT
the official datapack.)

Anyways, thanks for reading. Join our Discord if you'd like, and hope you enjoy!
